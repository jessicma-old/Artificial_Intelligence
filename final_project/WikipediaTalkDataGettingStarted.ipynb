These are the regimes that we need to effect a regime change sooner or later:==  Most urgent:  Iran, Syria, Communist China, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, Cuba, Liberia, Laos, Lebanon, Vietnam, Libya, Zimbabwe, Burma, Malaysia, Belarus, Venezuela, Moldova (elected an actual Communist Party member) Palestinian Authority  Less urgent, but necessary one day:  Brazil (I laid out a case for regime change in Brazil on another user's page. If you're interested, I can direct you to that page.), Ecuador (elected a Communist), Argentina (elected a Communist sympathizer), Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, Pakistan (the military dictator they have is ok to keep a lid on the Islamists, but he'll fall one day so we might as well occupy them), Qatar (Al Jazeria is based there spewing its anti-American propaganda), Tunisia, and every other country that is not a democracy or is a democracy that elects anti-democratic leftists like Hugo Chavez  Countries we should destabilize, but not necessarily prusue regime change through military means:  France, Germany, Belgium, Canada, Mexico, South Africa, Turkey, Russia, Sweden, and more...  ==Countries WHERE FREEDOM RINGS==  AMERICA (NUMBER ONE ON THIS ACCOUNT), UK, Australia, Israel, Italy , Spain, Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Czech Republic, and more...    Above: me at a pro-Iraq War rally.  ==COLLEGE REPUBLICANS MAKE A DIFFERENCE!!!!!!!!!!== http://www.crnc.org/    ==DO YOUR PART AMERICA: BOYCOTT FRANCE AND FRENCH GOODS.==   Above: THE OLD YELLER FRENCH ARMY KNIFE.   Evil exists. And militant Islamism (the militant Islamism of bin Laden, the Saudis, Saddam Hussein, the Baathists, and the Palestinian suicide bombers) or Islamofascism is the enemy of freedom and the distilled essence of evil. Totalitarian ideologies and fanaticisms have come in gone and have been defeated by America. All these ideologies are one in the same. They hate modernity, hate America, hate freedom, hate capitalism, hate liberal democracy, and love terrorism, oppression, genoicide, and fanatic hatred. In Germany the tyranical enemies of freedom and capitalism rallied behind Nazism, in Italy they rallied behind fascism, in Russia they rallied behind totalitarian socialism and communism, and now in the Middle East, where a lot of dictators and tyrants are threatened by freedom and American values, they rally behind militant Islamics. It is fact that there isnt a single Arab democracy. Muslim leaders (Saddam was just the worst of the lot. There will be more dictators/terrorists to fight like the Syrians) are all tyrants and terrorists who stifle the free press, kill their own people, crush their citizens hopes and dreams, and want to kill Americans like they did on 9/11. Their desire to kill Americans and supprot terror rests on one deep, abiding hatred: their irrational fear of America, which sticks up for freedom and opposes their tyranny with great scarafices, like America is doing right now defeating evil in the Arab countries of Iraq and Afghnaistan.   The ideology of militant Islamist terrorism is the totalitarian enemy that America confronts today. And patriotic Americans say it will be defeated like America defeated totalitarianisms in the past through heroic struggle: Communism, fascism, Nazism.   A lot of conservative commentators who speak with moral clarity call America's struggle against the evil of Islamofascist totalitarianism right now World War IV. That this is freedom's fourth struggle against a totalitarian evil. In WWI it was the despotic rule of the Kaiser, in WWII it was the Nazis, in freedom's third struggle it was the communists in the Cold War (although it wasnt a ``hot war`` it was another global stuggle like a world war). Now America's forth stuggle is a worldwide campaign against states like Iraq that hate the free world, kill their own people, desire weapons of mass destruction, and support terrorism.   The antiwar liberal left appeases totalitarian evil, which they love to do. They rallied to defend the Communists in Vietnam. Now the amoral liberal left is opposing America's commander in chief George W Bush in his struggle in Iraq. Hundreds of millions were slaughtered (Communism murdered 100 million people while the liberals opposed the Cold War at every step) and Communism threatened the freedom of America and her allies. Conservatives say that America must stop this new totalitarian enemy before its murderous hate claims as many victims as Communism.    `</td>\n",

To say that mathematics is not a science but a ``language`` ignores the fact that hundreds of journals are devoted to publishing new discoveries in mathematics. Obviously in judging publication-worthiness one considers how new discoveries may be relevant to potential future research; one considers esthetics (which for most mathematicians is the main motive for doing mathematics or for learning mathematics). Whence this loony idea that there is no need to consult history? Do you not see sections on how a new discovery fits into the historical development of the subject in many research papers in mathematics?

What happened to every claim? Anyway, to prove your case that Islam sanctions death sentence to its critics, you can't just post the names of isolated cases where people received death threats from anonymous radicals! You need to post the names of prominent Islamic scholars and universities such as Al Azhar (not isolated radicals) who issued the death sentence against these people. The fatwa  against Rushdie was rejected by Al Azhar and all countries except Iran. So all you need to do is post Islamic sites (not anti-Islamic sites and isolated radical sites) who issued the death sentence against Menji, Rashad Khalifa, Theo van Gogh, etc. Bring your proof. Just throwing the names of isolated cases where someone received death threats from isolated anonymous radical doesn't prove Islam sanctions death sentence to it's critics! After 9/11, many Muslims and mosques received threats and some Muslims/Sikhs were even killed. That doesn't mean the US sanctions death to all American Muslims.  You are such a pathetic joke, dude!  Posting isolated cases where people received death threats from anonymous radicals doesn't prove a thing. We don't even know for sure who killed Rashad. You added even his name. You need to post the names of Muslim scholars who issues death sentence against, say, Rashad, Vincent van Gogg, and Menji. Then you need to post evidence that this was consensus among Muslim scholars on each of these cases.  Without that, you don't have any case, and you are refuted once again    : ``Anyway, to prove your case that Islam sanctions death sentence to its critics, you can't just post the names of isolated cases where people received death threats from anonymous radicals!  You need to post the names of prominent Islamic scholars and universities such as Al Azhar (not isolated radicals) who issued the death sentence against these people. The fatwa  against Rushdie was rejected by Al Azhar and all countries`` &lt;- these anonymous radicals represent the sentiments felt by their factions in ISlam -they represent their interpretation of Islam. I also provided examples of critics who were murdered by MUHAMMAD himself. Al-Azhar is not a higher authority than Muhammad.  ::No, you have only provided two stories in Ibn Ishaq about Muhammad that are rejected by Muslims, such as rejected here.  Al Azhar and Muslim scholars will interpret what Muhammad did and what Islamic law says, not an anti-Islamic bigot like you. You made a bold claim that in Islam critics are to be to be killed. I refuted that by giving examples that contradict that. You then claimed that every critic received a death sentence. You were refuted again. You then posted a list of isolated critics such as Rushdie, Menji, Rashad Khalifa, Theo van Gogh, etc, who received death threats from anonymous radicals. That's like posting (a much longer list) of Muslims/Sikhs who received death threats or were killed after 9/11, and claiming that American law allows Muslims to be killed. You were refuted again.  You need to provide names of prominent well known Muslim scholars (not anti-Islam sites or isolated radicals) for each of these cases and prove that they issued the death sentence. After that, you need to provide proof that that judgement was a consensus among Muslims scholars. You didn't do that. You were refuted once again. Since you are an anti-Islamic bigot, you can't just claim that Muhammad did this or that or Islamic law says this or that and expect that claim to be inserted in Encyclopedia. You need to provide proof. You couldn't because you were wrong. Try again, dude. You have failed quite miserably here    :Furthermore, whe opinons of secular governments are irrelevant - of course Musilm countries rejected the death fatwa against Rushdie, but this was due to international politics, not due to religion. Also, as stated before, Ayatollah Khomenie was a Shiah CLERIC. The only way to be an Ayatollah is to be born as one. Aside from being the dictator or IRan, Khomenie was also the spiritial and religious leader of huge numbers of Sha'ias around the world. Khomenie wrote many fatwas and books about Islam. His most famous fatwa, of course, calls for the murder of Salman Rushdie. Now Al-Azhar - a SUNNI university  SUPPOSEDLY rejected KHomenei's teachings. This does not mean by any means prove that Al-Azhar was right, and Khomenie was wrong. The fact that KHomenie was a shiah cleric, while Al-Azhar is a sunni university is also a  gaping hole in this argument. You have no ev</td>\n",

You won't have the pain anymore.  Everyone else?  Don't worry, they'll get by.    What do you mean It's not your fault things turned out badly?  It certainly IS your fault.  You ought to be ashamed of yourself for what you've done  - and failed to do.  Maybe things could have changed if you weren't such  a weakling.  You're defective.  You've been that way for a long time.  You are proof that God makes mistakes.  Look at your life.  Failure after failure after failure.  And should we mention those ``things`` that you did?  You know what I'm talking about.  I can't believe you did that!  You disgust me.  You should have died a long time ago.  You know I'm right.    JUST DO IT!!!`</td>\n",

       "89320      Next, maybe you could work on being less condescending with your suggestions about reading the naming conventions and FDL, both of which I read quite a while ago, thanks. I really liked the bit where you were explaining why you had no interest in fixing things I complained about because you felt insulted, yet you were being extremely insulting at the time. With any luck, you can learn to be less of a jerk.

       "1319467   `GOD BLESS OUR FREEDOM FIGHTING TROOPS DEFEATING ARAB TERRORISM IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN.      DEFEAT totalitarian Islamofascism  ==Our commander in chief liberated Iraq and Afganistan. But there's much left to TAKE OUT and LIBERATE. These are the regimes that we need to effect a regime change sooner or later:==  Most urgent:  Iran, Syria, Communist China, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, Cuba, Liberia, Laos, Lebanon, Vietnam, Libya, Zimbabwe, Burma, Malaysia, Belarus, Venezuela, Moldova (elected an actual Communist Party member) Palestinian Authority  Less urgent, but necessary one day:  Brazil (I laid out a case for regime change in Brazil on another user's page. If you're interested, I can direct you to that page.), Ecuador (elected a Communist), Argentina (elected a Communist sympathizer), Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, Pakistan (the military dictator they have is ok to keep a lid on the Islamists, but he'll fall one day so we might as well occupy them), Qatar (Al Jazeria is based there spewing its anti-American propaganda), Tunisia, and every other country that is not a democracy or is a democracy that elects anti-democratic leftists like Hugo Chavez  Countries we should destabilize, but not necessarily prusue regime change through military means:  France, Germany, Belgium, Canada, Mexico, South Africa, Turkey, Russia, Sweden, and more...  ==Countries WHERE FREEDOM RINGS==  AMERICA (NUMBER ONE ON THIS ACCOUNT), UK, Australia, Israel, Italy , Spain, Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Czech Republic, and more...    Above: me at a pro-Iraq War rally.  ==COLLEGE REPUBLICANS MAKE A DIFFERENCE!!!!!!!!!!== http://www.crnc.org/    ==DO YOUR PART AMERICA: BOYCOTT FRANCE AND FRENCH GOODS.==   Above: THE OLD YELLER FRENCH ARMY KNIFE.   Evil exists. And militant Islamism (the militant Islamism of bin Laden, the Saudis, Saddam Hussein, the Baathists, and the Palestinian suicide bombers) or Islamofascism is the enemy of freedom and the distilled essence of evil. Totalitarian ideologies and fanaticisms have come in gone and have been defeated by America. All these ideologies are one in the same. They hate modernity, hate America, hate freedom, hate capitalism, hate liberal democracy, and love terrorism, oppression, genoicide, and fanatic hatred. In Germany the tyranical enemies of freedom and capitalism rallied behind Nazism, in Italy they rallied behind fascism, in Russia they rallied behind totalitarian socialism and communism, and now in the Middle East, where a lot of dictators and tyrants are threatened by freedom and American values, they rally behind militant Islamics. It is fact that there isnt a single Arab democracy. Muslim leaders (Saddam was just the worst of the lot. There will be more dictators/terrorists to fight like the Syrians) are all tyrants and terrorists who stifle the free press, kill their own people, crush their citizens hopes and dreams, and want to kill Americans like they did on 9/11. Their desire to kill Americans and supprot terror rests on one deep, abiding hatred: their irrational fear of America, which sticks up for freedom and opposes their tyranny with great scarafices, like America is doing right now defeating evil in the Arab countries of Iraq and Afghnaistan.   The ideology of militant Islamist terrorism is the totalitarian enemy that America confronts today. And patriotic Americans say it will be defeated like America defeated totalitarianisms in the past through heroic struggle: Communism, fascism, Nazism.   A lot of conservative commentators who speak with moral clarity call America's struggle against the evil of Islamofascist totalitarianism right now World War IV. That this is freedom's fourth struggle against a totalitarian evil. In WWI it was the despotic rule of the Kaiser, in WWII it was the Nazis, in freedom's third struggle it was the communists in the Cold War (although it wasnt a ``hot war`` it was another global stuggle like a world war). Now America's forth stuggle is a worldwide campaign against states like Iraq that hate the free world, kill their own people, desire weapons of mass destruction, and support terrorism.   The antiwar liberal left appeases totalitarian evil, which they love to do. They rallied to defend the Communists in Vietnam. Now the amoral liberal left is opposing America's commander in chief George W Bush in his struggle in Iraq. Hundreds of millions were slaughtered (Communism murdered 100 million people while the liberals opposed the Cold War at every step) and Communism threatened the freedom of America and her allies. Conservatives say that America must stop this new totalitarian enemy before its murderous hate claims as many victims as Communism.    `                                                       \n",

I can escalate till I am rhetorically nuclear with the whole goddamed mob of you if that is where you think you will find what you want.   You had better start expressing some interest in the concerns presented to you or your credibility as either a document or a community will be about that of a pile of shit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "3897107   `===Plautus satire's irresponsible comments are those of a crackpot.===  Plautus satire's comments are idiotic nonsense. I have refereed papers for five mathematics journals, and my published papers have been refereed (and some unpublished ones that I submitted). Obviously history is consulted; obviously proof-checking is not the main point of refereeing; obviously novel ideas are examined in the context of accepted notions. To say that mathematics is not a science but a ``language`` ignores the fact that hundreds of journals are devoted to publishing new discoveries in mathematics. Obviously in judging publication-worthiness one considers how new discoveries may be relevant to potential future research; one considers esthetics (which for most mathematicians is the main motive for doing mathematics or for learning mathematics). Whence this loony idea that there is no need to consult history? Do you not see sections on how a new discovery fits into the historical development of the subject in many research papers in mathematics?  Plautus satire's comments are those of a crackpot.    `                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "4619883   `  *Paragraph one: if you are uncertain as to whether Lincoln was an important spokesman for the American System, why on earth would you be editing this article?  *Paragraph two: I used the qualifier ``arguably,`` and I think it is justified to discuss the track record of the American System approach, which is now virtually unknown in its country of origin, to the track record of the other two options, which are normally the only ones discussed. Feel free to cite a success story for Marxism or Laissez-Faire. However, I agree that this paragraph might be better couched in a ``proponents of the American system assert a, and opponents respond with b`` format. I won't attempt to edit it, however, until we get arbitration, because you, Andy, and your cohorts, are in the ``revert, don't debate`` mode.  *Paragraph three: simple statement of fact. Can you name another outspoken proponent of the American System, other than LaRouche? Remember, your dislike or LaRouche, or of the American System, is not at issue.

       "8310740   `  == this is a joke, okay? ==  Darling, by DELETING an important poll on the Talk:Jesus page you have made it clear that you are a VANDAL and I will no longer recognize your existence.  Some people do believe that 1+1 does not equal 2 and you cannot CENSOR me for making that point.  As a matter of fact I can provie it right now: ==people who agree Eequor is a Vandal== # ==people who do not agree Eequor is a Vandal== # ==people who disagree that EEquor is a Vandal== # SEE!  Now I bet you will delete this also!  Which just proves you are a vandal! To summarize *Jesus told koans *is ``does 1+1 not equal 2`` not a koan? *arguments against me *I defend myself *some VANDAL deletes the arguments against me *I defend myself again  If you do or do not reply to this I will request a comment or arbitration or both but not at exactly the same time and I can prove it.

       "8357601   `   You abused your authority by blocking me improperly,, then you refused to apologize (“So tough”), then you tried to bully me (``Do not revert like you have been ever again. Understood?`` and now you are threatening me (``I'm not suggesting this time: I'm telling you: you need to change the way you edit. Now.``). Viriditas did  for activity that was not a violation of the three revert rule - and . Then he and Jayjg and sockpuppet friend continued to guard the Zionist hatchet job on Yasser Arafat preventing other editors from altering it and you dutifully protected the article for them while blocking me.

       "8359431   `  ::You are not worth the effort. You are arguing like Viriditas and Pename now. 24 hours really means 24 and a half hours. Four reverts in more than 24 hours is violating the ``spirit`` of the three revert in 24 hour rule - as interpreted by you. ``So tough.`` Who needs rules? Just make it up as you go along and do what you want - call it ``discretion``. You violate the rules by blocking me then claim I violated the ``spirit of the rule.``  Your violation is ``debatable`` like the Occupied Territories are ``disputed.`` You are just abusing your authority to push your petty authoritarian agenda that obviously reflects your personal insecurities. You think you can threaten and bully me.  ``And I guess you won't be reverting so quickly in future, will you now?`` What a weasel. Please go ahead and contribute your petty complaints to ban me so I don't bother wasting my time on a project populated by immature arrogant twerps, fascist Zionist bigots, Islamophobe hate-mongers, bunch of lameass bigots and losers.

       "8621412   `    ==death to critics==  So instead of  'every' earlier, now you are giving isolated cases, such as Theo van Gogh, Vincent van Gogh, Rashad Khalifa, and Irshad Manji who received death threats or were killed by anonymous unknown radicals.  What happened to every claim? Anyway, to prove your case that Islam sanctions death sentence to its critics, you can't just post the names of isolated cases where people received death threats from anonymous radicals! You need to post the names of prominent Islamic scholars and universities such as Al Azhar (not isolated radicals) who issued the death sentence against these people. The fatwa  against Rushdie was rejected by Al Azhar and all countries except Iran. So all you need to do is post Islamic sites (not anti-Islamic sites and isolated radical sites) who issued the death sentence against Menji, Rashad Khalifa, Theo van Gogh, etc. Bring your proof. Just throwing the names of isolated cases where someone received death threats from isolated anonymous radical doesn't prove Islam sanctions death sentence to it's critics! After 9/11, many Muslims and mosques received threats and some Muslims/Sikhs were even killed. That doesn't mean the US sanctions death to all American Muslims.  You are such a pathetic joke, dude!  Posting isolated cases where people received death threats from anonymous radicals doesn't prove a thing. We don't even know for sure who killed Rashad. You added even his name. You need to post the names of Muslim scholars who issues death sentence against, say, Rashad, Vincent van Gogg, and Menji. Then you need to post evidence that this was consensus among Muslim scholars on each of these cases.  Without that, you don't have any case, and you are refuted once again    : ``Anyway, to prove your case that Islam sanctions death sentence to its critics, you can't just post the names of isolated cases where people received death threats from anonymous radicals!

I also provided examples of critics who were murdered by MUHAMMAD himself. Al-Azhar is not a higher authority than Muhammad.  ::No, you have only provided two stories in Ibn Ishaq about Muhammad that are rejected by Muslims, such as rejected here.  Al Azhar and Muslim scholars will interpret what Muhammad did and what Islamic law says, not an anti-Islamic bigot like you. You made a bold claim that in Islam critics are to be to be killed. I refuted that by giving examples that contradict that. You then claimed that every critic received a death sentence. You were refuted again. You then posted a list of isolated critics such as Rushdie, Menji, Rashad Khalifa, Theo van Gogh, etc, who received death threats from anonymous radicals. That's like posting (a much longer list) of Muslims/Sikhs who received death threats or were killed after 9/11, and claiming that American law allows Muslims to be killed. You were refuted again.  You need to provide names of prominent well known Muslim scholars (not anti-Islam sites or isolated radicals) for each of these cases and prove that they issued the death sentence. After that, you need to provide proof that that judgement was a consensus among Muslims scholars. You didn't do that. You were refuted once again. Since you are an anti-Islamic bigot, you can't just claim that Muhammad did this or that or Islamic law says this or that and expect that claim to be inserted in Encyclopedia. You need to provide proof. You couldn't because you were wrong. Try again, dude. You have failed quite miserably here    :Furthermore, whe opinons of secular governments are irrelevant - of course Musilm countries rejected the death fatwa against Rushdie, but this was due to international politics, not due to religion. Also, as stated before, Ayatollah Khomenie was a Shiah CLERIC. The only way to be an Ayatollah is to be born as one. Aside from being the dictator or IRan, Khomenie was also the spiritial and religious leader of huge numbers of Sha'ias around the world. Khomenie wrote many fatwas and books about Islam. His most famous fatwa, of course, calls for the murder of Salman Rushdie. Now Al-Azhar - a SUNNI university  SUPPOSEDLY rejected KHomenei's teachings. This does not mean by any means prove that Al-Azhar was right, and Khomenie was wrong. The fact that KHomenie was a shiah cleric, while Al-Azhar is a sunni university is also a  gaping hole in this argument. You have no ev   \n",

       "8726328   `::I am not Goldberg and you can't prove otherwise because it is not true. I was blocked because MathKnight went whining about ``anti-semitism incitement`` based on my User page and some admin apparently believed him. Now the not rake blames me for personal attacks. Prove it. Where? This is just typical of those who gang up on their enemies without justification or evidence. Thankfully TBSDY is on the ball and not so easily fooled. I have violated no policy and I should receive some warning and description of the policy if I am. Just having some whiney Israeli complaining about anti-semitism shouldn't suffice to block users.

I am getting impatient with the Bahai censorshipmeisters and the incompetent low-IQ admin who has made a career for himself in Wikipedia by hanging around the Bahai articles where he doesn't even have the slightest qualification on the subject matter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "11006426  Oh hi Violet. I wanna call you babe but I have a feeling you're a cyber transvestite.  May I ask whether you're femme or not?  By that I mean a real femme, not some homo or similar abnormal case.  If you're a REAL FEMALE please provide me with some details about yourself and we'll take it from there.

       "11187140  `  Dear Squeakbox:  I have been very polite to you compared to your incredible persistent rudeness and use of three different identities upon me.  I have saved your entire string of correspondence, so have at it!   If I recall correctly, you threatened me with a Honduran jail for ``vandalising Wikipedia`` when I was the one who wrote correctly.  Moreover, I covered Solana's Spanish political career very thoroughly and you falsely accused me of not doing so.  It seems my biggest mistake was once writing ``Ferninand Gonazalez`` instead of ``Felipe Gonzalez`` which would have been a simple edit for you.  Instead, you launched an unseemly internet career of calling me ``a troll`` and a ``vandal`` among other things.  Then you proceeded to ridicule what you perceive as my religious beliefs, while simultaneously confessing to me the past two days (if it wasn't one more blind) your faith in Haile Selassie, the long dead ruler of Ethiopia as God Almighty!  If you want to talk patronizingly about religious beliefs, I could make one fine case out of that, but instead you want to rail and reduce Wikipedia to a Britannica Junior Encyclopedia and below.  Why don't you go pick on someone else!

       "11462967    ::You Zionist Jewbastard Khazar Turks just love filibusters that draw out this tragedy to no conclusion.  That's right, only YOU are allowed a say on the issue.  YOU have the right to editorialise anything to YOUR content, media mogul jackasses!  Stay out of London, New York, Washington and Hollywood!  Get the fuck out of America and stop dragging us into your stupid affairs with Muslims!  You deserved 9/11 and I hope more of you die from suicide bombings by economically tortured Muslims, just keep it in the Middle East.  Helen Clark did well to not take your shite!  I swear, I'll fucking kill you all if I ever go to Israel.  I'll take nukes signed by each and every Jew of the Manhattan Project and level you to nothing; in a eulogy to Theodore Herzl.  What irony, to die by the products of your own hands, that had me fear for my life in the fucking Cold War.  Mad scientists and loan sharks, fucking trash with no goddamn decency to Europe and America!  Wanderer gypsies, no sense of love for your own people enough to stick together on your own land.  Can't even settle down and do your own thing away from others.  Leave us and Rachel Corrie alone!  You have no respect for the dead!  To you, she was just another Goy puppet!  You will pay and I hope to personally see you die.  Perhaps a Tay-Sachs bio-weapon to plague and infest the lot of you until death do we part.  Take your Michael Medveds, Adam Sandlers and Bob Dylans and shove them up your arses!  No more Disraelis and Kerrys or Rothschilds and Greenspans will ruin our lives!  You bring disrepute to White males, by rewriting history; fucking up churches and schools in culture war.  You killed McKinley and the Romanovs.  Fuck your Sigmund Freud, Ron Jeremy and Ruth Westheimer pervert terrorists and kill yourselves NOW!  You fucking Howard Stern/Jerry Seinfeld/Eugene Levy garbage are no better than any other Semite like the Muslims themselves!  You anti-Semitic hypocrites have no feature but greed and barbarism!  I read the massacre at Clifford's Tower in York Castle and hope for another!  Your ritual child abuse still mutilates baby genitals, just like labia removal.  You are savages without civilisation and bloodsucking leeches holding onto hosts as all viruses do; so you are fake friends!

       "11573496    :Adming  is the one who abuses Wikipedia to force his stupid personal taste for just that one particular article.  He is an admin and tries to make just one article out of line with wikipedia standards and style.  Instead of bothering me, go ask that idiot why he tries to make Wikipedia articles inconsistent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

       "11757947  `  == Bye Bye Jerk! ==    I guess this means you will be crying about the Nazis anymore.  What is your problem with Nazis anyway?  Did you date a Nazi woman and she broke your heart??  What a shame!!!  Your life isn't worth living anymore so pleasee KILL YOURSELF!  You know I'm right.  You've felt this way for a long time.  You've probably been thinking about killing yourself for quite some time.  I'm here to tell you, it's all right.  Go ahead.  Do it.  It won't hurt. Be brave.  All your troubles will be over.  You won't have the pain anymore.  Everyone else?  Don't worry, they'll get by.    What do you mean It's not your fault things turned out badly?  It certainly IS your fault.  You ought to be ashamed of yourself for what you've done  - and failed to do.  Maybe things could have changed if you weren't such  a weakling.  You're defective.  You've been that way for a long time.  You are proof that God makes mistakes.  Look at your life.  Failure after failure after failure.  And should we mention those ``things`` that you did?  You know what I'm talking about.  I can't believe you did that!  You disgust me.  You should have died a long time ago.  You know I'm right.    JUST DO IT!!!`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

I'd suggest ignoring him, although he and user: Jewbacca have launched a campaign, re: arbitration, and the operant idea with such things is 'fighting like hell.' I find these people distracting and annoying. Sorry you had to deal with them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "11957964    == Bye bye jerk!! ==  I guess this means you will not be crying about the Nazis anymore. What is your problem with Nazis anyway? Did you date a Nazi woman and she broke your heart?? What a shame!!!     Your life isn't worth living anymore so pleasee KILL YOURSELF!      You know I'm right. You've felt this way for a long time. You've probably been thinking about killing yourself for quite some time. I'm here to tell you, it's all right. Go ahead. Do it. It won't hurt. Be brave. All your troubles will be over. You won't have the pain anymore. Everyone else? Don't worry, they'll get by. You never really did fit in in Australia or anywhere else for that matter.  Do what must be done.     What do you mean It's not your fault things turned out badly? It certainly IS your fault. You ought to be ashamed of yourself for what you've done in your failed life - and failed to do. Maybe things could have changed if you weren't such a weakling and hate-filled person. You're defective. You've been that way for a long time. You are proof that God makes mistakes.
