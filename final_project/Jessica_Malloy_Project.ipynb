And militant Islamism (the militant Islamism of bin Laden, the Saudis, Saddam Hussein, the Baathists, and the Palestinian suicide bombers) or Islamofascism is the enemy of freedom and the distilled essence of evil. Totalitarian ideologies and fanaticisms have come in gone and have been defeated by America. All these ideologies are one in the same. They hate modernity, hate America, hate freedom, hate capitalism, hate liberal democracy, and love terrorism, oppression, genoicide, and fanatic hatred. In Germany the tyranical enemies of freedom and capitalism rallied behind Nazism, in Italy they rallied behind fascism, in Russia they rallied behind totalitarian socialism and communism, and now in the Middle East, where a lot of dictators and tyrants are threatened by freedom and American values, they rally behind militant Islamics. It is fact that there isnt a single Arab democracy. Muslim leaders (Saddam was just the worst of the lot. There will be more dictators/terrorists to fight like the Syrians) are all tyrants and terrorists who stifle the free press, kill their own people, crush their citizens hopes and dreams, and want to kill Americans like they did on 9/11. Their desire to kill Americans and supprot terror rests on one deep, abiding hatred: their irrational fear of America, which sticks up for freedom and opposes their tyranny with great scarafices, like America is doing right now defeating evil in the Arab countries of Iraq and Afghnaistan. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe ideology of militant Islamist terrorism is the totalitarian enemy that America confronts today. And patriotic Americans say it will be defeated like America defeated totalitarianisms in the past through heroic struggle: Communism, fascism, Nazism. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENA lot of conservative commentators who speak with moral clarity call America's struggle against the evil of Islamofascist totalitarianism right now World War IV. That this is freedom's fourth struggle against a totalitarian evil. In WWI it was the despotic rule of the Kaiser, in WWII it was the Nazis, in freedom's third struggle it was the communists in the Cold War (although it wasnt a ``hot war`` it was another global stuggle like a world war). Now America's forth stuggle is a worldwide campaign against states like Iraq that hate the free world, kill their own people, desire weapons of mass destruction, and support terrorism. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe antiwar liberal left appeases totalitarian evil, which they love to do. They rallied to defend the Communists in Vietnam. Now the amoral liberal left is opposing America's commander in chief George W Bush in his struggle in Iraq. Hundreds of millions were slaughtered (Communism murdered 100 million people while the liberals opposed the Cold War at every step) and Communism threatened the freedom of America and her allies. Conservatives say that America must stop this new totalitarian enemy before its murderous hate claims as many victims as Communism. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN`</td>\n",

To say that mathematics is not a science but a ``language`` ignores the fact that hundreds of journals are devoted to publishing new discoveries in mathematics. Obviously in judging publication-worthiness one considers how new discoveries may be relevant to potential future research; one considers esthetics (which for most mathematicians is the main motive for doing mathematics or for learning mathematics).

What happened to every claim? Anyway, to prove your case that Islam sanctions death sentence to its critics, you can't just post the names of isolated cases where people received death threats from anonymous radicals! You need to post the names of prominent Islamic scholars and universities such as Al Azhar (not isolated radicals) who issued the death sentence against these people. The fatwa  against Rushdie was rejected by Al Azhar and all countries except Iran. So all you need to do is post Islamic sites (not anti-Islamic sites and isolated radical sites) who issued the death sentence against Menji, Rashad Khalifa, Theo van Gogh, etc. Bring your proof. Just throwing the names of isolated cases where someone received death threats from isolated anonymous radical doesn't prove Islam sanctions death sentence to it's critics! After 9/11, many Muslims and mosques received threats and some Muslims/Sikhs were even killed. That doesn't mean the US sanctions death to all American Muslims.  You are such a pathetic joke, dude!  Posting isolated cases where people received death threats from anonymous radicals doesn't prove a thing. We don't even know for sure who killed Rashad. You added even his name. You need to post the names of Muslim scholars who issues death sentence against, say, Rashad, Vincent van Gogg, and Menji. Then you need to post evidence that this was consensus among Muslim scholars on each of these cases.  Without that, you don't have any case, and you are refuted once again  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN: ``Anyway, to prove your case that Islam sanctions death sentence to its critics, you can't just post the names of isolated cases where people received death threats from anonymous radicals!

The fatwa  against Rushdie was rejected by Al Azhar and all countries`` &lt;- these anonymous radicals represent the sentiments felt by their factions in ISlam -they represent their interpretation of Islam. I also provided examples of critics who were murdered by MUHAMMAD himself. Al-Azhar is not a higher authority than Muhammad.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::No, you have only provided two stories in Ibn Ishaq about Muhammad that are rejected by Muslims, such as rejected here.  Al Azhar and Muslim scholars will interpret what Muhammad did and what Islamic law says, not an anti-Islamic bigot like you. You made a bold claim that in Islam critics are to be to be killed. I refuted that by giving examples that contradict that. You then claimed that every critic received a death sentence. You were refuted again. You then posted a list of isolated critics such as Rushdie, Menji, Rashad Khalifa, Theo van Gogh, etc, who received death threats from anonymous radicals. That's like posting (a much longer list) of Muslims/Sikhs who received death threats or were killed after 9/11, and claiming that American law allows Muslims to be killed. You were refuted again.  You need to provide names of prominent well known Muslim scholars (not anti-Islam sites or isolated radicals) for each of these cases and prove that they issued the death sentence. After that, you need to provide proof that that judgement was a consensus among Muslims scholars. You didn't do that. You were refuted once again. Since you are an anti-Islamic bigot, you can't just claim that Muhammad did this or that or Islamic law says this or that and expect that claim to be inserted in Encyclopedia. You need to provide proof. You couldn't because you were wrong. Try again, dude. You have failed quite miserably here  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Furthermore, whe opinons of secular governments are irrelevant - of course Musilm countries rejected the death fatwa against Rushdie, but this was due to international politics, not due to religion. Also, as stated before, Ayatollah Khomenie was a Shiah CLERIC. The only way to be an Ayatollah is to be born as one. Aside from being the dictator or IRan, Khomenie was also the spiritial and religious leader of huge numbers of Sha'ias around the world. Khomenie wrote many fatwas and books about Islam. His most famous fatwa, of course, calls for the murder of Salman Rushdie. Now Al-Azhar - a SUNNI university  SUPPOSEDLY rejected KHomenei's teachings. This does not mean by any means prove that Al-Azhar was right, and Khomenie was wrong. The fact that KHomenie was a shiah cleric, while Al-Azhar is a sunni university is also a  gaping hole in this argument. You have no ev</td>\n",

       "89320     Next, maybe you could work on being less condescending with your suggestions about reading the naming conventions and FDL, both of which I read quite a while ago, thanks. I really liked the bit where you were explaining why you had no interest in fixing things I complained about because you felt insulted, yet you were being extremely insulting at the time. With any luck, you can learn to be less of a jerk.

And militant Islamism (the militant Islamism of bin Laden, the Saudis, Saddam Hussein, the Baathists, and the Palestinian suicide bombers) or Islamofascism is the enemy of freedom and the distilled essence of evil. Totalitarian ideologies and fanaticisms have come in gone and have been defeated by America. All these ideologies are one in the same. They hate modernity, hate America, hate freedom, hate capitalism, hate liberal democracy, and love terrorism, oppression, genoicide, and fanatic hatred. In Germany the tyranical enemies of freedom and capitalism rallied behind Nazism, in Italy they rallied behind fascism, in Russia they rallied behind totalitarian socialism and communism, and now in the Middle East, where a lot of dictators and tyrants are threatened by freedom and American values, they rally behind militant Islamics. It is fact that there isnt a single Arab democracy. Muslim leaders (Saddam was just the worst of the lot. There will be more dictators/terrorists to fight like the Syrians) are all tyrants and terrorists who stifle the free press, kill their own people, crush their citizens hopes and dreams, and want to kill Americans like they did on 9/11. Their desire to kill Americans and supprot terror rests on one deep, abiding hatred: their irrational fear of America, which sticks up for freedom and opposes their tyranny with great scarafices, like America is doing right now defeating evil in the Arab countries of Iraq and Afghnaistan. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe ideology of militant Islamist terrorism is the totalitarian enemy that America confronts today. And patriotic Americans say it will be defeated like America defeated totalitarianisms in the past through heroic struggle: Communism, fascism, Nazism. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENA lot of conservative commentators who speak with moral clarity call America's struggle against the evil of Islamofascist totalitarianism right now World War IV. That this is freedom's fourth struggle against a totalitarian evil. In WWI it was the despotic rule of the Kaiser, in WWII it was the Nazis, in freedom's third struggle it was the communists in the Cold War (although it wasnt a ``hot war`` it was another global stuggle like a world war). Now America's forth stuggle is a worldwide campaign against states like Iraq that hate the free world, kill their own people, desire weapons of mass destruction, and support terrorism. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe antiwar liberal left appeases totalitarian evil, which they love to do. They rallied to defend the Communists in Vietnam. Now the amoral liberal left is opposing America's commander in chief George W Bush in his struggle in Iraq. Hundreds of millions were slaughtered (Communism murdered 100 million people while the liberals opposed the Cold War at every step) and Communism threatened the freedom of America and her allies. Conservatives say that America must stop this new totalitarian enemy before its murderous hate claims as many victims as Communism. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN`   \n",

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI can escalate till I am rhetorically nuclear with the whole goddamed mob of you if that is where you think you will find what you want. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou had better start expressing some interest in the concerns presented to you or your credibility as either a document or a community will be about that of a pile of shit.

       "3897107  `===Plautus satire's irresponsible comments are those of a crackpot.===NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPlautus satire's comments are idiotic nonsense. I have refereed papers for five mathematics journals, and my published papers have been refereed (and some unpublished ones that I submitted). Obviously history is consulted; obviously proof-checking is not the main point of refereeing; obviously novel ideas are examined in the context of accepted notions. To say that mathematics is not a science but a ``language`` ignores the fact that hundreds of journals are devoted to publishing new discoveries in mathematics. Obviously in judging publication-worthiness one considers how new discoveries may be relevant to potential future research; one considers esthetics (which for most mathematicians is the main motive for doing mathematics or for learning mathematics). Whence this loony idea that there is no need to consult history? Do you not see sections on how a new discovery fits into the historical development of the subject in many research papers in mathematics?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPlautus satire's comments are those of a crackpot.

Feel free to cite a success story for Marxism or Laissez-Faire. However, I agree that this paragraph might be better couched in a ``proponents of the American system assert a, and opponents respond with b`` format. I won't attempt to edit it, however, until we get arbitration, because you, Andy, and your cohorts, are in the ``revert, don't debate`` mode.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN*Paragraph three: simple statement of fact. Can you name another outspoken proponent of the American System, other than LaRouche? Remember, your dislike or LaRouche, or of the American System, is not at issue.

Also, I don't beleive that Shorne is a troll any more than I beleive you are a troll. -  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::: I have added responses to the above.  This is a tu quoque argument.

I have each time: taken the page to talk. have tried to compromise your reversions. Only reverted you because you reverted yourself, in most cases losing information. Allow my to continue the history log a bit later. Then we'll see. -  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::: And I'm guessing you're not expert on Shorne, so what you think probably shouldn't have much weight.  01:

Viriditas did  for activity that was not a violation of the three revert rule - and . Then he and Jayjg and sockpuppet friend continued to guard the Zionist hatchet job on Yasser Arafat preventing other editors from altering it and you dutifully protected the article for them while blocking me.

What happened to every claim? Anyway, to prove your case that Islam sanctions death sentence to its critics, you can't just post the names of isolated cases where people received death threats from anonymous radicals! You need to post the names of prominent Islamic scholars and universities such as Al Azhar (not isolated radicals) who issued the death sentence against these people. The fatwa  against Rushdie was rejected by Al Azhar and all countries except Iran. So all you need to do is post Islamic sites (not anti-Islamic sites and isolated radical sites) who issued the death sentence against Menji, Rashad Khalifa, Theo van Gogh, etc. Bring your proof. Just throwing the names of isolated cases where someone received death threats from isolated anonymous radical doesn't prove Islam sanctions death sentence to it's critics! After 9/11, many Muslims and mosques received threats and some Muslims/Sikhs were even killed. That doesn't mean the US sanctions death to all American Muslims.  You are such a pathetic joke, dude!  Posting isolated cases where people received death threats from anonymous radicals doesn't prove a thing. We don't even know for sure who killed Rashad. You added even his name. You need to post the names of Muslim scholars who issues death sentence against, say, Rashad, Vincent van Gogg, and Menji. Then you need to post evidence that this was consensus among Muslim scholars on each of these cases.  Without that, you don't have any case, and you are refuted once again  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN: ``Anyway, to prove your case that Islam sanctions death sentence to its critics, you can't just post the names of isolated cases where people received death threats from anonymous radicals!

I also provided examples of critics who were murdered by MUHAMMAD himself. Al-Azhar is not a higher authority than Muhammad.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::No, you have only provided two stories in Ibn Ishaq about Muhammad that are rejected by Muslims, such as rejected here.  Al Azhar and Muslim scholars will interpret what Muhammad did and what Islamic law says, not an anti-Islamic bigot like you. You made a bold claim that in Islam critics are to be to be killed. I refuted that by giving examples that contradict that. You then claimed that every critic received a death sentence. You were refuted again. You then posted a list of isolated critics such as Rushdie, Menji, Rashad Khalifa, Theo van Gogh, etc, who received death threats from anonymous radicals. That's like posting (a much longer list) of Muslims/Sikhs who received death threats or were killed after 9/11, and claiming that American law allows Muslims to be killed. You were refuted again.  You need to provide names of prominent well known Muslim scholars (not anti-Islam sites or isolated radicals) for each of these cases and prove that they issued the death sentence. After that, you need to provide proof that that judgement was a consensus among Muslims scholars. You didn't do that. You were refuted once again. Since you are an anti-Islamic bigot, you can't just claim that Muhammad did this or that or Islamic law says this or that and expect that claim to be inserted in Encyclopedia. You need to provide proof. You couldn't because you were wrong. Try again, dude. You have failed quite miserably here  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Furthermore, whe opinons of secular governments are irrelevant - of course Musilm countries rejected the death fatwa against Rushdie, but this was due to international politics, not due to religion. Also, as stated before, Ayatollah Khomenie was a Shiah CLERIC. The only way to be an Ayatollah is to be born as one. Aside from being the dictator or IRan, Khomenie was also the spiritial and religious leader of huge numbers of Sha'ias around the world. Khomenie wrote many fatwas and books about Islam. His most famous fatwa, of course, calls for the murder of Salman Rushdie. Now Al-Azhar - a SUNNI university  SUPPOSEDLY rejected KHomenei's teachings. This does not mean by any means prove that Al-Azhar was right, and Khomenie was wrong. The fact that KHomenie was a shiah cleric, while Al-Azhar is a sunni university is also a  gaping hole in this argument.

       "8726328  `::I am not Goldberg and you can't prove otherwise because it is not true. I was blocked because MathKnight went whining about ``anti-semitism incitement`` based on my User page and some admin apparently believed him. Now the not rake blames me for personal attacks. Prove it. Where? This is just typical of those who gang up on their enemies without justification or evidence. Thankfully TBSDY is on the ball and not so easily fooled. I have violated no policy and I should receive some warning and description of the policy if I am. Just having some whiney Israeli complaining about anti-semitism shouldn't suffice to block users. Selective enforcement of etiquette to silence editors is bias and censorship. Where is the policy, where is the evidence of violation? Where is the accountability?

       "37675         this is not   creative     those are the dictionary definitions of the terms   insurance   and   ensurance   as properly applied to   destruction     if you dont understand that  fine  legitimate criticism  ill write up   three man cell   and   bounty hunter   and then it will be easy to understand why   ensured   and   insured   are different   and why both differ from   assured     the sentence you quote is absolutely neutral   you just arent familiar with the underlying theory of strike back  e g  submarines as employed in nuclear warfare  guiding the insurance  nor likely the three man cell structure that kept the ira from being broken by the british   if thats my fault  fine  i can fix that to explain   but theres nothing   personal   or   creative   about it   im tired of arguing with you   re  the other article    multi party   turns up plenty  and there is more use of   mutually   than   mutual     if i were to apply your standard id be moving   mutual assured destruction   to   talk   for not appealing to a reagan voters biases about its effectiveness  and for dropping the   ly     there is a double standard in your edits   if it comes from some us history book  like   peace movement   or m a d  as defined in 1950  you like it  even if the definition is totally useless in 2002 and only of historical interest     if it makes any even obvious connection or implication from the language chosen in multiple profession specific terms  you consider it somehow non neutral     gandhi thinks   eye for an eye   describes riots  death penalty  and war all at once  but you dont   what do you know that gandhi doesnt   guess what   reality is not neutral   current use of terms is slightly more controversial   neutrality requires negotiation  and some willingness to learn   this is your problem not mine   you may dislike the writing  fine  that can be fixed   but disregarding fundamental axioms of philosphy with names that recur in multiple phrases  or failing to make critical distinctions like insurance versus assurance versus ensurance  which are made in one quote by an air force general in an in context quote   is just a disservice to the reader   if someone comes here to research a topic like mad  they want some context  beyond history   if this is a history book  fine  its a history book   but that wasnt what it was claimed to be                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

       "103624     i removed the following   all names of early polish rulers are ficticious and therefore this index naming oda von haldensleben and her husband dagome records for the first time rulers of the polanen tribe  therefore it is indicated as being the first document of the later developing land named poland   this is quite a comment  all names are fictitious  it deserves at least some backing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "111032       if you ever claimed in a judaic studies program that ultra orthodox jews dont have rabbis  or dont have synagogues  you would be laughed out of the room      i am beginning to see the problem you have  you see  you do not know how to read what other people say without attaching your personal bias to it  never once did i say that ultra orthodox jews have no rabbis or synagogues  i did say that the role of the rabbi and synagogue in ultra orthodox judaism is minimal when compared with  say  conservative judaism  they are not clergy  in the traditional western sense of the word  that is a fact  as for synagogues  they exist  but they are not essential  minyan  a quorum of ten adult males in ultra orthodox law  is essential  you can have a minyan without a synagogue  but a synagogue without a minyan is an empty building  you can laugh all you want  but it doesnt change the facts  it may seem strange to you  but take the statement to anyone who actually knows something  i want to know who laughs then     if you ever claimed in a recognized judaica studies program that a significant number of ultra orthodox rabbis accept and follow modern orthodox responsa  instead of their own   people would look at you as if you had two heads      also a silly point  if you were to draw such sharp distinctions between ultra orthodox and modern orthodox judaism in a recognized judaic studies program  they would not know what you are talking about  a  that statement is false  because responsa in orthodoxy does not work on the basis of someones synagogue affiliation  b  what is a modern orthodox responsa versus an ultra orthodox responsa  c  in cases where things like hashgacha  kosher certification  etc   are debated  you will find in most cases that it is not a question of responsa  if you know something about responsa literature in general  which apparently you do not   there are degrees of acceptance  for example  halav yisrael  milk under rabbinical supervision during milking to ensure that it comes from a cow   most modern orthodox jews do not insist on it t on the basis of a responsa by rabbi moshe feinstein who determined that american government supervision is sufficient  most ultra orthodox jews do insist on it  they do not reject the responsa  in fact  moshe feinstein  reb moshe  as he was called  was considered the leading halachic authority for the american ultra orthodox community in the past fifty years  they will say that the ruling is right but they want to be machmir  more strict on themselves  meaning more pious   it is not a rejection  it is simply being stricter  ovadya yoseph said women could wear pants instead of skirts  would any of his daughters or daughters in law be caught dead in pants  no way  they are machmir     you just cant make this stuff up  danny      i dunno  i seem to be giving answers to everything you say  and my answers are based on sources  i am not making things up  i am simply stating things that  no matter how inconceivable it may be  you do not know     stop trying to re make the ultra orthodox in your own image  its not good history  frankly  i dont care what is on your resume  it doesnt justify writing such nonsense   rk    personal attacks  i will say that your intellectual arrogance coupled with your apparent ignorance do not put you in a very good light    in my professional life  i have researched and written extensively on this field  developed relationships  both working and personal  with many of the people involved  and worked on several important documentary films on the topic  i think i have a sense of what npov is  and a statement that the ultra orthodox   hate   the non ultra orthodox just doesnt make the mark      is beating the shit out of non orthodox jews an act of love  is calling them   worse than hitler   an act of love  is accusing them of creating the holocaust an act of tolerance  danny  you can protest all you like  but you obviously so immersed in an ultra orthodox worldview that you cant see the forest for the trees  this is violent hatespeech  and it frightens me to see an educuated person making apologetics for it  rk     then it must frighten you even more knowing that i was actually there  and on one occasion  actually hit   why  because i do not feel the same antagonism that you do  because i see some distasteful remarks in a certain context  you say in your diatribe that you want everyone to sit together and sing a shlomo carlebach niggun  just answer me this though  would reb shloime have davened in a shul without a mehitza    oh  and haredi does not mean   trembling    as you originally wrote at the top of the article  in fact  that was kind of funny  you were apparently confused with the film trembling before god  which    \n",

       "192579               i fail to see the distinction   who better than legal scholars to define what the law is   moreover  my comments in re how legal scholars define the law were a response to your dubious assertion that law qua law can be defined as a   decision process     that assertion has no place in the main law article         i disagree   the enactment of a statute falls under the topic of legislation         these issues are not law qua law  they are topics which should be discussed under the ambit of particular legal topics  such as   statutory interpretation   or   contracts    or related topics  such as   sociology   and   political science           law qua law is first and foremost a body of knowledge   the academic field to which you refer is the study of that body of knowledge  and should be considered as part and parcel of the discussion found in the main law article  the profession of law is the application of that body of knowledge  which should be discussed in the   practice of law   article                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

       "252031          no  i really havent heard of either one  at least not that i recall  ive heard of extreme positions  usually in a dismissive and ironic way  but dont really know their details  they really are on the fringe and not held by the majority of feminists  ive been involved with several feminist groups  usually working on local issues  but i am by no means a feminist scholar  i only have a general knowledge about feminism and especially how it is practice within now  of which i am a member  i dont follow the literature  for example     i am truly committed to maintaining a npov  and i hope you are too  im not convinced of that  though  please consider making an attempt to carefully state that the beliefs of certain subgroups of feminism are not necessarily beliefs feminists as a whole agree on  readers will make their own judgement about which beliefs they buy and which they dont  it isnt up to us to steer them one way or another  and have a happy holiday  dmerrill                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

       "290598            thats another relevant empirical question  if there really are millions of people who would be horribly offended by   christian mythology    then perhaps its justifiable to avoid the term even if its otherwise a good term   but if its just a few oversensitive ninnies  and most reasonable people can come to accept the non pejoritive use of the term if its explained  then i see no reason to avoid it   i rather like   scientific mythology   personally  and wish it were restored   ldc                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "344567       changed macedonia link to macedon  ancients didnt call their land macedonia  and the entry we have on   macedonia   isnt useful for alexander  should probably have an article on macedon  and take the one sentence about alexander out of macedonia  maybe with a   see also      i dont particularly have a problem with macedon/macedonia  but dont the naming conventions suggest that articles be named based on their most popular usage  rather than their most correct usage  if theres a difference    perhaps using macedonia to refer to recent history and macedon for ancient history would work  with   see also   back and forth    blain   my native language is greek and i can assure you that macedon and macedonia is the same thing  macedonia is the   modern   way to say macedon  maybe you should change back the link to macedonia from macedon  if the article about macedonia is not informative enough you could always change it    just a note about the relationship between aristotle and alexander  those two were two different personalities and they used to clash a lot but alexander did something that makes me wanter if their relationship was as bad as people think today  while he was invading asia he would send to his teacher all new and interesting animals that he would incounter in his expedition because he knew that old aristotle was almost obsessed with the classification of things  the result was that aristotle formed a kind of a zoo back in macedonia from the gifts of his student  now  if young alexander was so sick of his teacher why did he bother     good point   i think alexander was complicated enough that trying to determine who he liked and who he didnt  and which was safer  isnt all that easy   he was known to treat his enemies rather well and to kill his friends when they ticked him off   i think he might have respected aristotle and just not wanted to spend time around him anymore   just a thought  blain   the most recent edits to this article are very strange  why change egypt to   pgypt      why delete the paragraphs that were deleted  can someone give me a reality check on this                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "699848324      these sources dont exactly exude a sense of impartiality  newsweek is a better start  but it still is an article written by someone with an ax to grind  would an article from breitbart be as easily accepted  i hope not  but that page from that massanari woman seems a bit lacking  especially considering it uses such an inflammatory  biased word as   toxic   in its own abstract   i doubt my words will have much effect since the consensus by wiki admins  the only ones who really matter around here  seems to be stuck in place  but for anyone else reading this  consider the damn sources  single studies  politicos writting polemics  etc  etc                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What are the features you considered using? What features did you use in the final code?\n",
    "The only features I ended up using in my code were 'comment' and 'attack', although I considered using 'logged_in', 'ns', and 'sample' as well. Ultimately, I couldn't figure out how to use those features to improve the model, so they were left out of the final code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What optimizations did you add in your code, if any?\n",
    "I used GridSearch on the SGDClassifier model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What hyper-parameter tuning did you do?\n",
    "For all models, I tried tuning a few parameters each for CountVectorizer (max_features, n_grams, min_df, stop_words) and TfidfTransformer (norm, sublinear_tf). I kept whichever setting improved the model's performance the most. For the individual classifiers, I selected the parameters that seemed most likely to improve performance for that specific model--for example, n_estimators for RandomForest and loss for SGDClassifier. I also tried a few things that didn't work, like excluding stop words (both from a premade list and using max_df), and setting class_weight='balanced' as a parameter on some models. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### What did you learn from the different metrics?\n",
    "The model accuracy and AUC were both very helpful for getting an idea of overall performance. The confusion matrix and other stats (precision, recall, etc.) were more useful for figuring out how the model was actually classifying things; for example, most models were more likely to mistake rude comments for polite ones than vice versa, probably because the training set had more polite comments in it. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Did you try cross-validation?\n",
    "No :(\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What are your best final Result Metrics? By how much is it better than the strawman figure?\n",
    "\n",
    "|                   | strawman | final  | improvement |\n",
    "| ----------------- |:--------:|:------:| -----------:|\n",
    "| AUC               | 0.957    | 0.959  | 0.002       |\n",
    "| Accuracy          | 94.05%   | 95.04% | 0.99%       |\n",
    "| Average precision | 0.94     | 0.95   | 0.01        |\n",
    "| Average recall    | 0.94     | 0.95   | 0.01        |\n",
    "| Average f1-score  | 0.93     | 0.95   | 0.02        |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Which model gave you this performance?\n",
    "My best final results metrics were for the Linear SVM model after tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is the most interesting thing you learned from doing the report?\n",
    "I looked up the most predictive features for each model to verify that it was working correctly (using the `print_top10_features` function). The most predictive words for the attack comments were all curse words, except for the word 'you', which showed up a few times. This makes sense, since a lot of attacks are directly addressing the person being attacked. Similarly, the most predictive words for polite comments were 'thanks' and 'thank you'. It was highly predictive of both attack and polite comments (depending on the order), which is probably partly why every model did better when stop words were included.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What was the hardest thing to do?\n",
    "As a model improved, it became very hard to get it to improve further with tuning. The Naive Bayes' model had the greatest improvement after tuning, but it started out with the worst performance. The Logistic Regression and LinearSVM models were both fairly high without tuning, and it was difficult to find a combination of parameters where either of them improved significantly."

      "Comment text:     you got what had been coming to you  i hope that being a k3wl eleet nerd o pedia moderator has made your life hell     from someone that you totally wronged with your bullshit and managed to get me to stop contributing very significant contributions to this site nearly a year ago now  (and i contributed a lot in a short time and would have contributed so much more had i continued  things that i did  huge amounts of professional class photography given away for free (placed pd) on subjects (often providing the only pics  to this day  on the subjects in question)  hundreds of pages formatted according to standards  huge amounts of latest subject matter information added and facts corrected (in some cases so new that this was the first place on the net to have it) etc  etc )   and instead of helping me and being civil  sensible and using common sense you were more interested in defending a non contributing user who (for no apparent reason) started a campaign of open violent threats  death threats  spamming and vandalism on me  you were having too much fun abusing your moderator privileges by placing temporary blocks on me  trying to stop me from making my point and trying to give this hugely offensive other user a chance to avoid a police investigation  by mod vandalizing discussions on the subject etc    against most other moderators (private) views even   they had the sense not to start a mod war on the subject  your 500 page nerd o pedia rule book and abusing it to the point of idiocy was more interesting to you  apparently you felt that since you had read it  everyone else should waste at least as much time and read it too down to every last letter  or you were gonna use it against all common sense toward anyone who didn't   with no regard for the actual situation and reasons behind it  no regard for that individuals contributions  no regard for civility   and most of all  with no common sense applied whatsoever   it's indeed too bad that most pages on nerd o pedia are starting to be shockingy un maintained and obsolete  indeed dead now that the initial rush of contributors is over after a few years  and the fun is over for most people   as  the most brutal blow of all  moderators such as you have managed to destroy the morale of even the most serious contributors and have had them leave  they simply did not wish to spend too much time arguing or alternatively face putting up with arrogant admin behavior  because it always will start to take more of your time than contributions here  because of people like you  and how wrong the principles are how admins are selected here  it's all about brown nosing with the crowd and building your giant online virtual ego and lick the ass of other even more ocd nerds who are already admins  and you're just a wannabe    good ****ing luck trying to get anything edited or updated here in a year or two besides top 10 whatever pop bands may be popular at the time  the latest tv show pages and some other obsessive compulsive nerdishm  nobody is foolish enough to put up with the crap that comes along with the job  from people such as you   for example  the pages on my subjects were very active till late 2006  and since that they have    well  remained in the same form as the core contributors left them  as they left this site  no updates  i'm truly not the only one to eject  not worth the effort to contribute when all you get is shitted all over  if you ever need any help   it's kind of funny that an admin can burn out of this site too  but given your attitude back then  i'm not surprised you did  after all  there were some decent admins here back then (such as  )  and i'm sure there's a few now  but way too many nerds for whom it is the biggest thing of their lives  and they have to show it  and snoop their noses everywhere  but like i said  as even admins are dropping out  what do you think happened to the contributors  many pages now are actually full of incorrect shit  because no people of expertise hang around any more to correct details  and newbies or worse  malicious trollers slowly degrade the content that once was at least somehow accurate and relevant  admins will be happy to see updates to the page  but the fact is  most of the updates today are degenerating the pages  obfuscating subjects and adding factual errors and garbage   and too bad you didn't quit a year ago  i might still be here  and there would probably be several thousands of lines  and few hundred articles more  along with maybe ~1000 more photographs  good riddance   \n",

      "Comment text:        unblock me you asshoes       {{unblock|hahaahahahahahahaha unblock me or i will vandalise more      it had been six years since we had graduated from college  and for the first time since graduation  all three of us were together again  from the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home  it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact  the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable   having returned to my cozy  semi secluded home in the suburbs  we all sat in the living room  sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives  with the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol  it could have been any of our final two years of college together  the three of us  tight knit friends with benefits  sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together  then  justine and beth had been roommates while i lived in another dorm across the main quad  now  they were much welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend   as i sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine  i allowed my eyes to truly linger on justine as she told beth about a recent situation at work  the florida sun had certainly added a glow to justine's skin  and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder length brown hair  as when we were in college together  she wore virtually no make up  just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor  as i had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails  her red dress was indeed elegant  with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage  a display which beth and i both certainly appreciated  the long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt  one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well toned thigh  the red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes  surprisingly  however  she wore hoop earrings  something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe   the conversation turned back toward me  but a few minutes later  the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other  i took the opportunity to once again study beth  and was equally impressed  while noticeably shorter than justine  beth was also paler in complexion  a testament to living in northern canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research  as in college  beth preferred the color black for her outfits  a somewhat tight sweater  form fitting slacks  and a pair of low heels  four tiny earrings adorned each ear  plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril  beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front  and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to justine   it felt so good to be in their presence once again  especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college  i was thankful that i had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me  i had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy  but for now  i was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa   the intimacy began when we finally went to bed    together  i was on my back under the covers  with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder  an arm wrapped around each of them  i held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest  dipped a finger into my navel  brushed my thighs through the sweatpants i typically wore to bed  caressed my stiffening manhood  my eyes closed  i reveled in their touches  inherently familiar  yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time   no words were needed  and as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me  i smiled to myself in the darkness  having always enjoyed watching beth and justine in their own intimate encounters  but eventually  their touches slowed and ultimately ceased  their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep  i stayed awake a little longer  immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life   i awoke in the morning to the scent of french roast coffee  faint yet unmistakable  justine was gone  clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar  while beth and i held each other as she slept  the feel of her pajama covered breasts against me was a welcome sensation  as it had been over a year since i had last even hugged a woman  simply waking up in the morning and not finding myself alone in bed was a tremendous thrill in itself  walking up with beth in my arms made the morning extremely special for me   gently  i kissed her forehead  and she stirred in my arms  she was clearly lost in that odd hazy phase between sleep and consciousness as she nudged me to my back and lay upon me  underneath the covers  i slowly caressed her as i kissed the top of her head  a few minutes later  as beth finally awoke and lifted her head to give me a semi conscious smile  justine nudged open the bedroom door and carried three mugs of coffee on a tray     just like old times seeing you two like that    justine quipped with a smile  beth simply giggled softly  awakening further as i held her a little tighter   deciding we wanted bagels for breakfast  i headed out into the snow and to a family owned bagel shop a few blocks away  when i returned  my two beautiful guests were still upstairs  and i was not at all surprised to open the bedroom door and find that justine's sleep shirt had been removed  she knelt upon the bed  straddling beth's waist as each woman lovingly touched each other     just like old times seeing you two like that    i parroted with a smile  justine simply laughed softly  her eyes inviting me to join them  while it was indeed tempting  i knew that they both would want – and need – some intimate time alone together  so  despite my growing erection  i simply approached the bed long enough to give each of them a gentle kiss to the cheek before retreating from the bedroom  closing the door to allow them their privacy   as i sat in the dining room with a bagel and a newspaper  i eventually heard justine's beautiful cry  and instantly knew that i had made the correct decision in leaving my two longtime friends alone upstairs  simply imaging what beth had possibly done to produce such an exquisite sound was arousing in itself  and i found my hand stroking slowly at the front of my jeans   after my guests had eaten  while justine showered  beth and i retired to the living room  sitting on the sofa with the stunning young woman straddling my lap  i gazed deep into her eyes as she gently stroked my chest through my sweatshirt  after a few moments  our lips naturally drew together  the slow kiss at once warm and electrifying   my hands wandered from beth's shoulders to her chest  squeezing her breasts gently and feeling her contented moan  i slowly began to unbutton her pajama shirt as the kiss continued  baring her torso to my view once she leaned back from me and helped me to remove the black garment     bite me hard    she requested breathily    just like you use to do     rising up on her knees  beth leaned toward me  offering a breast to my lips  my hands cupping her lower cheeks  i took the proffered nipple into my mouth  sucking gently like a newborn baby for a few moments before trapping the lengthening bud between my teeth and tugging gently  the change in breathing above me signaled that i was doing exactly as she wanted  as she perhaps needed  and i tugged a bit harder  then a bit harder  then a bit harder   then i bit her  firmly  at the base of the nipple  her hands stiffened at the back of my head  and the hiss above me was unmistakable  my own hands moving up her back to hold her in place  i bit her again  harder  holding the bite for several seconds before releasing her breast from my mouth  for a moment  i looked fondly upon the markings left behind by my teeth  then switched to her other breast and bit my longtime friend again  the soft groan evidence that i was indeed hurting her   with one arm still wrapped around her back  my free hand moved between her thighs and began to stroke her sex through the pajama bottoms and panty she wore  i felt beth shudder as i bit her again – harder – and stroked her with a little more force  i continued biting her and stroking her  enjoying her sounds of hurt and delight  drawing the sweet nectar from her so that i could feel it upon my fingers despite the two layers between my hand and her sex  eventually  however  i stopped biting her  alternately simply kissing and suckling each breast  i stroked her with more force as she moved against my hand until  finally  her orgasm overtook her  her hands clutching my head to her chest and her powerful  heavy breaths irregular and full of desire and thankfulness   as beth calmed  i kissed her between her breasts  directly over her heart  and she lowered herself so we could share a warm kiss     you two make a nice picture     blushing and giggling softly as we held each other  beth and i both turned toward justine for a moment  then beth hid her \n",

      "Comment text:   {{unblock|thank you for a reasonable fucking comment    the only user in any area who has actually made one    (ebyabe made comments which appear to be reasonable at first glance  but are actually unreasonable because one is fraudulent and the other was untrue regarding a place where she could see that it was untrue )  well a sort of reasonable comment anyway because he claims that i am being   confrontational   when it is clearly visible at my talk page that other users are attacking me and not the other way around   i have not caused any confrontation      i have replied to other users who are putting a confrontation to me   (i did ask how to report a user  but i did not actually report him because nobody answered regardless of several posts made  and the user himself did not comment there  so that was not a confrontation like it would have been if i'd been able to make the report )  i would like to leave a message at this user 's talk page but i cannot  because for some reason those are blocked to  so i have to do it this way instead   hopefully he has the notifications turned on (tags of username)   i can be calm and work with other people   this is noted in my first reply  where it gives several examples of how users should have had discussion instead of attacking and reverting me and arguing hostilely on my talk page   users who wish to work with me should not make attacks  write words like   compliance    revert edits when they could have further fixed the edit instead (details of referred to edits in a separate paragraph below  make false claims against me  or delete my replies on discussion pages (not talk pages) and then archive it after removing them    (users should not do these kinds of things to anyone )  what this means is that if users act in a reasonable manner  then a normal discussion can ensue (including from myself)   merely because someone has used a template  written a shorter reply  or wrote their aggressive  confrontational remarks in a business style manner  does not mean that they are   being reasonable   or   writing nicely     when someone makes a falsified report about you or writes a falsified comment  etc   it is not reasonable to expect the victim to reply without mentioning this  or to want to   be friends   with the attacker   if the other people are being reasonable then of course i am going to reply to them in a different way   editing an article by   (below) is not reasonable  nor is   ganging up   (the discussion page)  nor is replying in several places at once  etc   how can replying to other users stating bad and/or false things about you be   confrontational     i have mentioned several times about having an actual discussion but no one did this and instead just kept replying on my talk pages   the fact that i mentioned having a discussion indicates that i think reasonable discussion is the right or reasonable way to do it   just no one wanted to do anything but attack me so i did not have another way   the headlines are not   veiled    they are in plain light   it was not any attempt to be   hidden     for headline #5  i literally do or did not know of a different way to title this headline which is not an attack on myself   for headline #8  it is truthful and the falsification was blatant by ebyabe  and i actually expected her to edit it to something on her next message   i mean she directly mentions it  edit summary says a reason but her message says differently (directly  not implied)   for this headline  it is not a   personal attack   because it is true and evident  administrator complains about my signature even though signature has been changed  and messages by me since posted  before the block happened  as well as direct linking to comments which contain no personal attacks as a reason for   personal attacks     if the titles were untrue they would be attacks  but since they are true unambiguously then they can't be attacks  the last headline yes  somewhat motivated/hostile  because he is the one put an useless headline so that there's two at once  *after* my notice is up  while also writing the things that show the actual tyranny (a word used in this case solely because it is already being talked about  and not meant as any attack/instigation/hostile/etc )  although the link by jamie appears to say something about political opinions  if someone is making false claims then it is appropriate for them to be exposed    so as you can see my intents are to be reasonable and normal (with the 'possible' exception of this particular headline)  and repeatedly asking other people to do this  but being annoyed by all their attacks and false remarks as well   edits (in a separate paragraph so that reading it is optional)    users working with me should not   revert edits when they could have further fixed the edit instead     instead of reverting multiple times  attacking  and then harassing  the user could have simply improved my previous edit if the felt it necessary   it actually was  in fact  necessary  because most of the paragraph was based on the incorrect idea that black people often check the   white   box on surveys because of      social characteristics  or something  and in order for it to both be accurate and make sense  additional things would have to have been removed   these are the things that i left in in order to avoid conflict  even though though it makes the article make much less sense in regards to flow when they are left in   i included in a comment several times that we should be fixing the problem with a reasonable discussion (poll) in order to get the correct version up  but this was ignored except for one derogatory remark that mentioning reasonable solutions should not be done  editing an article by reverting back to the incomprehensible version is hardly   reasonable     editing it again if the first person got it wrong   because they couldn't properly figure out what it was talking about   is the reasonable way      \n",
